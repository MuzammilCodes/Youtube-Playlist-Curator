            <b>Privacy and Data Usage Policy</b> <br><br>

            Your privacy is important. This website does not track, collect, store or share any personal data. The only
            interaction with
            user data occurs when the website integrates with the YouTube Data API. Here's how it works: <br><br>

            <b>Data Source:</b> The website retrieves data from the YouTube Data API once the user logs in with their
            Google account. <br>
            <b>Actions on Data:</b> Users can view and manage their YouTube playlists directly. Actions such as
            selecting or removing <br>
            videos are performed in real-time through the YouTube Data API. <br>
            <b>No Data Storage:</b> The website does not save any user data on its servers. All data interactions are
            strictly limited to
            the user's current session and occur between the user's browser and the YouTube Data API. <br>
            <b>Transparency:</b> The website operates under the principle of minimal data usage, solely for the purpose
            of enhancing user control over their YouTube playlists. <br> <br>
            This website uses only essential session cookies necessary for Google OAuth authentication. No tracking or marketing
            cookies are used. <br>
            
            <div class="heading">Data Protection Mechanisms:</div>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Secure HTTPS Connections:</b> All data transmissions are encrypted using HTTPS to protect user data during transit.</li>
                <li><b>OAuth 2.0 Protocol:</b> We use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.</li>
                <li><b>Session-Only Data Handling:</b> User data is handled only during the active session and is not stored on our servers.</li>
                <li><b>Access Controls:</b> Only authorized personnel have access to the systems that interact with the YouTube Data API.</li>
            </ul>

           <div class="heading">Retention and Deletion of Google User Data:</div>
            <ul>
                <li><b>No Data Storage:</b> As we do not store any user data, there is no retention period. All data interactions are session-based and are terminated once the session ends.</li>
                <li><b>User Data Deletion:</b> Users can manage their data directly through the YouTube Data API. Since we do not store any data, there is no need for a separate deletion process.</li>
            </ul>
            
            This application uses Google APIs and adheres to the Google Terms of Service (<a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">https://policies.google.com/terms</a>) <br>
            
            By ensuring that no data is tracked or stored, the website aligns with best practices for user privacy and protection. <br>
